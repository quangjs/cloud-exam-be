    ],
    "correctAnswer": ["B"],
    "explanation": "Spread placement groups place instances on distinct underlying hardware. This reduces the risk of simultaneous failures that could occur when instances share the same underlying hardware. Spread placement groups are recommended for applications that have a small number of critical instances that should be kept separate from each other.",

    "correctAnswer": ["D"],
    "explanation": "Standard Reserved Instances with a 3-year term and All Upfront payment provide the maximum discount (up to 72% compared to On-Demand). For steady-state, predictable workloads running continuously for 3 years, this option offers the greatest cost savings. Spot Instances are not suitable as they can be interrupted.",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": ["C"],
    "explanation": "EC2 Instance Store provides temporary block-level storage physically attached to the host computer. It offers the highest I/O performance because it is directly attached to the instance. Instance store is ideal for temporary storage of data that changes frequently, such as buffers, caches, and scratch data. Data on instance store volumes is lost when the instance is stopped, terminated, or fails.",

    "correctAnswer": ["B"],
    "explanation": "Dedicated Hosts are physical servers with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use. Dedicated Hosts provide visibility and control over how instances are placed on the physical server, including visibility into the number of sockets and physical cores. This is essential for using existing server-bound software licenses that have per-socket or per-core licensing requirements.",
